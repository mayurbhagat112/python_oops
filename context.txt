1. Class and Obj (example)
2. class has data/attribute and function/method
   > code walkthrough
   > attribute get called itself,methods are called manually
3. what is speciality of constructor or special method init?
- create a function optionally pass the data.
when we developer a software using oops concept constructor funtionlity user intiated that thing in backend connect with Database non tech user dont know about it.
these all define under the constructor 
in realife constructor use properties and data type define user do this manually 

4. why python is called oop? everything in python is an object (data structure,data type etc)


5. Advantages of oops:
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability as template
    > debugging from staring to end there high chance
    > easy to colab.


6  End to End project
   > function vs method
   > magic method vs dunder method
   > self
   > you can create attribute outside class as well as
   > encapsulation
   > getter and setter
   > static method
   > inheritance
